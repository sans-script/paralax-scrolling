## Description

This project that I learned on a youtube tutorial demonstrates a basic implementation of the parallax effect using HTML and CSS. The parallax effect is achieved by adjusting the position of different elements on the page in response to the user's scroll.

## How it Works

The webpage consists of a background image (`bg.jpg`) and several layers, including a moon (`moon.png`), mountains (`mountain.png`), and a road (`road.png`). The text "Moon Light" is also included in the composition.

The parallax effect is achieved through a simple JavaScript script that adjusts the position of each element based on the user's scroll. As the user scrolls down or up, the elements move at different speeds, creating a visually appealing parallax effect.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sans-script/paralax-scrolling.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Scroll up and down to experience the parallax effect.
